Dev & ops. Skeptical & enthusiastic. Big on helping others achieve their full potential.

Love Kotlin. It doesn't show here, but time allowingâ€¦

For fun, I run the [ident.me](https://api.ident.me) and [srv.us](https://srv.us) services, and play as much [Teeko](https://teeko.cc) as I can.

If I didn't react to something on GitHub, I probably didn't see it. Drop me [an E-mail](mailto:pc@rrier.ca)!
